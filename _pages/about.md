Hello! I'm Duo Zheng (ÈÉëÈìé).      
I am a second-year multi-modal master student at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (2020-2023). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaojie Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaojie-Wang-19). Currently, I am working closely and advised by [Dr. Tao Kong](https://www.taokong.org/) from AI Lab, ByteDance. I previously interned at [WeChat AI](https://ai.weixin.qq.com/) (2021-2022, Research Intern). I also received B.Eng. from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (2016-2020).

My primary research interests lie in vision-language and dialogue system. I am particularly interested in vision-language pre-training and other downstream tasks (e.g., reference expression, visual dialogue and VQA).
